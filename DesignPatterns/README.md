# Design Patterns
This repo serves as a playground for building and experimenting with different design patters.
All patterns follow from the 1994 book "Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, et al.


## Structure
Each pattern has its own folder in the .Net solution, which contains a project named after the pattern that holds the code,
as well as a project that holds test cases to run against the pattern code
